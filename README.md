# Markov Model for Health Technology Assessment (HTA)

📊 This repository contains an **Excel-based Markov model** built from scratch to compare two drug treatments under the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) framework. The model simulates patient transitions across health states, calculates costs and QALYs, and derives cost-effectiveness outcomes such as the **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)** and **Net Monetary Benefit (NMB).**

---

## 🔍 Overview
- **Tool Used:** Microsoft Excel  
- **Objective:** Compare two treatments by evaluating health outcomes and economic value.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Define health states & structure the model  
  - Apply transition probabilities & treatment effects  
  - Assign costs and QALYs  
  - Calculate ICER & Net Monetary Benefit  
  - Visualize results with occupancy plots, survival curves, and cost charts

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Download the Excel file.  
2. Open the model in Excel.  
3. Adjust input parameters (transition probabilities, treatment effects, costs, etc.).  
4. Review outputs → costs, QALYs, ICER, and plots.

## 📊 Outputs
- Health state occupancy over time  
- Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) curves  
- Cost breakdowns by treatment  
- ICER and Net Monetary Benefit
